 How to Compile and Run (Visual Studio 2010)

1.  Create a Project**:
    Open Visual Studio 2010.
    Go to `File -> New -> Project
    Select Win32 Console Application. Give it a name and click OK.
    In the wizard, click Next, ensure Console application and Precompiled header are checked, and then click Finish.

2.  Add the Code:
     Replace the contents of the main `.cpp` file generated by Visual Studio with the provided C code.

3.  Prepare the Data File:
     Create a file named `Universe.csv`.
     This file must contain your data, with each line representing one 12-dimensional vector. The numbers on each line should be separated by commas.
   
4.  Place the Data File:
     Copy the `Universe.csv` file into the project's output directory. This is typically inside your project folder in a subfolder named `Debug`.

5.  Build and Run:
     Press F7 to build the project.
     Press F5 to run the program. The output will appear in the console window.
