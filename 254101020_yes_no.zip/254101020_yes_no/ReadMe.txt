explaination:-

1.obseved the waveform and tried to guess the noise energy by doing trial and error.
2.created a pointer f1 which will point to null 
3.opened the file and f1 is now pointing to it 
4.if opening is done withoutb any error the variable error will store the null else value other than null
5.if condition to check that the file is opened withoutb any error
6.now we will run the while loop to store the two recorded words in different array
7.recording was started with some initial noice and then first word and second seperated by ambient noise, so i have used 
  here the instantanious energy and threshold energy to differentiate word and noise.
8.next two for loops to calculate the zcr of the two word to check weather who is the word yess
